## Abstract

Built from scratch in 1960, Brasília currently ranks as the fourth-largest urban agglomeration in Brazil. The objective of this paper is to describe the evolution of Brasília's urban structure between 1975 and 2015 using satellite data from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) at a 1km x 1km grid level. Firstly, it is observed that the population density and built-up gradients in Brasília are positive: as one moves away from the city center, both density and urbanized area increase. Additionally, these gradients present strong spatial heterogeneity in the intra-urban area and became more stepper in the period between 1975 and 2015. This can be attributed to the more intense urban growth of the urban fringe and the emergence of high-intensity clusters in suburban areas and, simultaneously, to a stable and low occupancy in the city center. Finally, our findings also indicate that Brasília exhibits a singular pattern of urban land use compared to other similar urban agglomerations in Brazil, characterized by low density in the center and high levels of urban sprawl.

## Data

The data used in this paper is obtained from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL). GHSL provides raster data of global spatial information describing human presence on the planet. Population data of Brasília is obtained from the GHS-POP dataset provided by the GHSL, which depicts the spatial distribution of the residential population expressed as the number of people per grid cell of 1km by 1km (or 100 hectares). We also utilize the GHS-BUILT-S dataset, which provides an estimate of the urbanized area per each 1 km² grid cell. Both datasets are for the period between 1975 and 2015, using 5-year intervals.

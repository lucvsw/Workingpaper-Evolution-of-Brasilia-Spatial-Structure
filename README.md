## Abstract

Built from scratch in 1960, Brasília currently ranks as the fourth-largest urban agglomeration in Brazil. The objective of this paper is to describe the evolution of Brasília's urban structure between 1975 and 2015 using satellite data from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) at a 1km x 1km grid level. Firstly, it is observed that the population density and built-up gradients in Brasília are positive: as one moves away from the city center, both density and urbanized area increase. Additionally, these gradients present strong spatial heterogeneity in the intra-urban area and became more stepper in the period between 1975 and 2015. This can be attributed to the more intense urban growth of the urban fringe and the emergence of high-intensity clusters in suburban areas and, simultaneously, to a stable and low occupancy in the city center. Finally, our findings also indicate that Brasília exhibits a singular pattern of urban land use compared to other similar urban agglomerations in Brazil, characterized by low density in the center and high levels of urban sprawl.
